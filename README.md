# Assignment
## Reflection-ASSIGNMENT 1 NALI 2023<br>
  The activity NALI 2023 experience was enlightening,shows me a glimpse into the future of education through technology. Presenters from the event always show us their product that aim to foster continuous improvement and innovation in educational practices.

  From the reflection and interview we made in that event,i learned a lot of things,including the focus on engaging students through interactive and immersive experiences is evident in several projects.For instance, the Leap Space application encourages students to explore the solar system interactively, while the E-bike tracking system addresses the practical needs of students on campus.<br><br>
  My suggestion for improving this assignment is that our team members should dare to communicate more. When there are problems, we should tell the team members immediately so that everyone can solve the problems together to prevent the problems from becoming more serious,because at that time, our team members divided the work when doing this assignment. A problem occurred and one of the team members failed to complete the work within the deadline.
