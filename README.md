# Assignment
<img src="Image/NALI.png" alt="Image 4" width="450" height="500"><br>
## Reflection-ASSIGNMENT 1 NALI 2023<br>
  The activity NALI 2023 experience was enlightening,shows me a glimpse into the future of education through technology. Presenters from the event always show us their product that aim to foster continuous improvement and innovation in educational practices. As technology continues to evolve, integrating these advancements into education will be key to preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the future.For example,Encourage the development of more diverse learning tools and methods to suit different type of courses and learning styles.<br><br>
  From the reflection and interview we made in that event,i learned a lot of things,including the focus on engaging students through interactive and immersive experiences is evident in several projects.For instance, the Leap Space application encourages students to explore the solar system interactively, while the E-bike tracking system addresses the practical needs of students on campus.<br><br>
  My suggestion for improving this assignment is that our team members should dare to communicate more. When there are problems, we should tell the team members immediately so that everyone can solve the problems together to prevent the problems from becoming more serious,because at that time, our team members divided the work when doing this assignment. A problem occurred and one of the team members failed to complete the work within the deadline.<br><br>

  ## Reflection on PC Assemble<br>
  From this activity,our group able to assemble and reassemble PC with our own hand with lecturer's instruction and our teamwork.Its a good learning opportunity for us because it involves understanding various components such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, power supply, and cooling systems. This hands-on experience deepens your understanding of how these parts function together.Further more,those knowledge is nessecary for us to enhancing troubleshooting skills, understanding system architecture, and fostering customization abilities. It also promotes cost-effective resource allocation because PC provide cost effective manner comparing to laptop.<br><br>
  ## Reflection on Design thinking<br>
  My goal from learning this course is to try my best to learn about technology and information systems within this limited time, and then effectively use this knowledge to improve your own level and career.

From this project, I learned how to use the Internet to conduct surveys, understand user needs, and how to track progress and complete projects in a planned way. This knowledge will lay a solid foundation for my career and bring me closer to my goals.<br><br>
In order to maximize my potential, I will be more active in learning various IT knowledge, participating in various projects, observing the needs of people around me, and creating the best projects to solve people's needs.<br><br>
My suggestion for improving this project is our group should create a higher quality prototype to increase feasibility.Besides of that,we can conduct various survey through more channel or platform,for example visiting users in person to understand needs.
